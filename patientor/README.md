> ## Exercises 9.8.-9.9.

**Before you start the exercises**

For this set of exercises you will be developing a backend for an existing project called **Patientor**, which is a simple medical record application for doctors who handle diagnoses and basic health information of their patients.

The [frontend](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/patientor) has already been built by outsider experts and your task is to create a backend to support the existing code.

## 9.8: Patientor backend, step1

Initialise a new backend project that will work with the frontend. Configure eslint and tsconfig with the same configurations as proposed in the material. Define an endpoint that answers to HTTP GET requests to route **/api/ping**.

The project should be runnable with npm scripts, both in development mode and, as compiled code, in production mode.
